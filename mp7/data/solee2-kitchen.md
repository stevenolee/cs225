Steve wanders around in the kitchen. He looks around for any food for a snack.

# solee2-apple
He sees an apple...wow it looks so crunchy, delicious, and healthy too. Plus, apple has got to be the most well-known word in the world that starts with an A!

# solee2-orange
Could Steve name his company "Orange"? No, his pet dog doesn't like citrus.

# solee2-chips
He sees a bag of chips! So temptign to eat, but he is on a diet. Steve finds no inspiration from a bag of chips.

# solee2-banana
Could Steve name his company "Banana"? No, that's too long.
