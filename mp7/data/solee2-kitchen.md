Steve wanders around in the kitchen. He looks around for any food for a snack.

#kitchenChips
He sees a bag of chips! Could he name his company "Crispy"? No that sounds bad, plus he is on a diet anyways. 

#apple
He sees an apple...wow it looks so crunchy, delicious, and healthy too. Plus, apple has got to be the most well-known word in the world that starts with an A!
